**Value Type:** 
* A value type variable stores actual values.
     
* Values types are of two types - built-in and user-defined. 
     
* Value types are stored in a stack and derived from System.ValueType class.


**Reference Type:**    
* A reference type variable stores a reference to the actual value. Typically, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that stores the actual data. 
    
* Reference types are of two types - built-in and user-defined. 
    
 * Reference types are stored in a heap and derived from System.Object class.
