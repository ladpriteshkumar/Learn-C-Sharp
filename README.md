         Value Type: 
     A value type variable stores actual values.
     
     Values types are of two types - built-in and user-defined. 
     
     Value types are stored in a stack and derived from System.ValueType class.


        Reference Type: 
    A reference type variable stores a reference to the actual value. Typically, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that stores the actual          data. 
    
    Reference types are of two types - built-in and user-defined. 
    
    Reference types are stored in a heap and derived from System.Object class.
